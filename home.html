			<p class="content">World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the fourth released game set in the fantasy Warcraft universe, which was first introduced by Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994.[4] World of Warcraft takes place within the Warcraft world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous Warcraft release, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.[5] Blizzard Entertainment announced World of Warcraft on September 2, 2001.[6] The game was released on November 23, 2004, on the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise.</p>
			
			<p class="content">The first expansion set of the game, The Burning Crusade, was released on January 16, 2007.[7] The second expansion set, Wrath of the Lich King, was released on November 13, 2008.[8] The third expansion set, Cataclysm, was released on December 7, 2010. The fourth expansion set, Mists of Pandaria, was released on September 25, 2012.[9] The fifth expansion set, Warlords of Draenor, was announced at BlizzCon 2013[10] and was released on November 13, 2014.[11]</p>
			
			<p class="content">With over 10 million subscribers as of November 2014,[12] World of Warcraft is currently the world's most-subscribed MMORPG,[8][13] and holds the Guinness World Record for the most popular MMORPG by subscribers.[14][15][16][17] Having grossed over 10 billion dollars as of July 2012, it is also the highest grossing video game of all time, surpassing Call of Duty: Black Ops at 1.5 billion dollars.[18] In January 2014 it was announced that more than 100 million accounts had been created over the game's lifetime.[19]</p>

			<p class="content">As with other MMORPGs, players control a character avatar within a game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. Also similar to other MMORPGs, World of Warcraft requires the player to pay for a subscription, either by buying prepaid game cards for a selected amount of playing time, or by using a credit or debit card to pay on a regular basis.[20]
			To enter the game, the player must select a server, referred to in-game as a realm. Each realm acts as an individual copy of the game world, and falls into one of four categories. Available realms types are:</p>
			
			<p class="content">As characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character.[25] Characters can choose from a variety of professions, such as tailoring, blacksmithing, or mining. Characters can learn four secondary skills: archeology, cooking, fishing, and first-aid.[26][27] Characters may form and join guilds, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild's chat channel, the guild name and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, and dues.[28]
			Much of World of Warcraft play involves the completion of quests. These quests, also called "tasks" or "missions", are usually available from NPCs.[29] Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points, items, and in-game money. Quests allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities, and explore new areas.[30] It is through quests that much of the game's story is told, both through the quest's text and through scripted NPC actions.[31] Quests are linked by a common theme, with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another.</p>
			
			<p class="content">While a character can be played on its own, players can group with others to tackle more challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in a way that they can only be overcome while in a group. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group.[29][32] World of Warcraft uses a "rested bonus" system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game.[25] When a character dies, it becomes a ghost—or wisp for Night Elf characters—at a nearby graveyard.[30] Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability, or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If a character is past level ten and they resurrect at a graveyard, the items equipped by the character degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character's body is unreachable, they can use a special "spirit healer" NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called "resurrection sickness" for up to ten minutes, depending on the character's level. This "resurrection sickness" does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by locating its body, or is resurrected by another player through special items or spells.[33][34]</p>
